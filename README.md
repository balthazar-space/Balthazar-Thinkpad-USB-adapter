# About

This is a project attempting to make a USB keyboard/Trackpoint controller and enclosure for the non-chiclet Thinkpad keyboard (from the 10/20 generation, such as the T410, W520, X2xx series etc.). 
the idea is to connect a ThinkPad keyboard as a foreign or extrenal add-on to a housing fitting in a provided frame. External keyboard connects via click-on controller to the ThinkPad-adapter, which connects to our Unifying PCB.

# Controller

The current plan is to use an RP2040 microcontroller running QMK to handle the key matrix scanning and Trackpoint for TP keyboard.
